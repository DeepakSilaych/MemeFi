# MemeFi Project Structure

## Project Overview

MemeFi is a decentralized, non-custodial trading platform specifically designed for meme coins. The platform combines traditional trading mechanics with gamification elements to create an engaging user experience. Users can participate in interval-based trading (1-5 minutes) by predicting price movements, earn rewards through a comprehensive points system, and contribute to liquidity pools. The platform features both PvP and PvE trading environments, ensuring fair and engaging trading experiences while maintaining market integrity. A robust risk management system and reliable price oracles protect both traders and liquidity providers.
